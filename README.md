## Instructions to add a code reference

- Use english.
- Identify the best category (folder) where the problem fits.
- Add the file with a name in **snake_case**.
- Choose the language: Python or C++, or both (in this case, both files should have the same name, changing only the extension).
- Add the first line of the comment with the title, followed by a brief description, observations, and finally, the complexity (time and, if relevant, space complexity).
- For the final file in C++, consider `<bits/stdc++.h>` already imported.
- Focus on readability. Follow good Clean Code practices, with descriptive names for variables, functions, and structures, using **snake_case**, and proper separation into functions and variables.
- Make sure to test your code, preferably on real problems.
- If necessary, you can reference another code to consider a function or structure previously "imported."
